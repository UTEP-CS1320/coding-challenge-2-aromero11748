### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

I think that the code that i wrote today was really easy to do because all that was needed 
was to follow the numbers that were in the chart and make them print out what was happening
. Overall it would have been a lot easier to just use a lot of If statments for each part
however since we had to limit the amount we used i used the & signs and also the || sign. 
Becuase with the use of this i could cut out the amount of if statments by half which i 
feel like is a lot to cut out. I do think however there is a way to do this without any 
if statments at all. Like maybe assign certian numbers a variable or intager and when 
those numbers are between those rangers you can just have the int print out the statments
or something like that. howeveri think my idea was okay it was after pretty simple to 
complete just from prior knowledge of the Zybooks. The only part that was a little diff
icult was seeing how to format the statments because it was a little tricky to me but 
hopefully it works becuse the run button was not working for me.
